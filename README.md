# Food-on-Wheels
Food on Wheels is a Food Delivery Management System available as a desktop application. This application will help restaurants and customers prepare/make orders using a desktop application that will make their orders as simple as a click of a button away.

NOTE: The GUI of this program doesnot properly works, but the console based code works properly so that's why I have made seprate classes for GUI code and linked it. To run console based code you have to run "Main" file and to run GUI based code just run "mainGUI" file
